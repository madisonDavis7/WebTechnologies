**Summary**
I copied the assignment and fed it into the Ecosia AI model to see what it would create. Then I compared what I had created to what AI cae up with. 

What I created:
* I went for a simple page with a few images for my favorite artists that when hovered over showed their names. I also added two buttons at the bottom that show my favorite websites and games in the console when clicked.

What AI created:
* After putting the assignment into AI it came up with the idea to have a clean background, no images, and include a welcome message. Along with text saying to check the console for more information. The messages were also
structured differently, in a numbered list style instead of havig all three favorites in one line as I do. For the prompt AI chose to ask the user what their favorite color was, where I chose to ask their name and greet them.

**Thoughts:**
* I would not rely on this because it lacks the creativity I wanted for the page. I think there were some good ideas for structuring my logs but I prefer my own desgns in terms of page aesthetic.
* Yes I could understand what code was written and what each part did.
* If I added some more specifications it could feel more like my work but would still not be nearl as satisfying as coming up with my ow ideas and implementing those.
