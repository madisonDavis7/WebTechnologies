            <h2> A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering. I'm graduating this May and
                hope to continue
                my internship with ELM Utilities. I've known I wanted to pursue computer science since about my junior
                year of highschool, though it's only
                been recently I discovered I lean more towards UI/UX work and the design aspect.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Minecraft is one of the first video games I played as a child. I had it on my IPad and spent countless
                hours building and exploring. When I first began playing
                I was around 7 or 8 and only played Creative, I refused to do Survival and not have access to
                everything. I have two siblings who also played, and we would all sit
                together, each in our own worlds, and play for hours. This is one of the few games that I continue to
                play and enjoy just as much. When I first discovered coding I thought
                I would go into game design, it seemed like a good way to mix programming with creativity. However,
                after going the softwar engineering route and eventually taking a
                game programming class, I realized it wasn't for me. Instead I decided that web design was a better fit
                or mizing my passions. I do still take inspiration from games I play
                and would like to make my own small pixel game one day, but that's more a side project than a real goal.

        <h2>Defining Memory</h2>
        <p>
            One of my first memories playing Minecraft was with my siblings in our living room. We were all playing on
            our IPads, my sister and I were probably 10/11 and my brother 7/8. When we
            began playing we were not allowed to go online, even to join eachother's worlds. So when we finally
            convinced our mom to let us it was a big deal.
            We had decided we were going to create a Survival world and all join. I really only ever played creative so
            I didn't realize that there were mobs and hostile
            monsters at night. I remember we were all talking excitedly, interrupting eachother, and trying to lead. It
            was chaos in the best way. I vividly recall
            seeing my first spider and thinking I wanted to make it my pet. The animals were one of my favorite parts of
            the game. I found out very quickly
            that spiders were in fact not pets and died pretty quickly. After that day we would play for as long as we
            could get away with, trying to build the
            best base and get the most resources.
