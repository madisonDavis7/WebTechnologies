To create a basic landing page for our site. Make use to standard HTML structuring and CSS styles. 

**Reflection**

1. Which tag controls content?
    - The <body> tag controls what content will be on the page. Everything that users see will be within the body.

2. Which part controls style?
    - The css for styling can either be put in the header with a <style> tag, or can be put in a css file and linked using a <link> tag. 

3. What was one thing you changed that had a big visual impact?
     - Adding the background color and having everything center aligned made it look much more appealing and modern to me. Having color and structure makes a page more interesting and eye catching.
